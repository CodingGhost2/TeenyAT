Goal: Create functions to:

Open a graphical window.
Draw a pixel sprite (your player) at a specific (x, y) coordinate.
Draw your level using tiles.
The for(;;) loop in main.cpp just runs the TeenyAT clock as fast as possible. You need a standard game loop that manages timing, updates, and rendering.
Open a graphical window.
Draw a pixel sprite (your player) at a specific (x, y) coordinate.
Draw your level using tiles.
Step 2: Create a Proper Game Loop
Action: In main.cpp, restructure your main function into a game loop.
Code Structure:
C++
// In main.cpp

while (window.isOpen()) {

// 1. Handle Events (like closing the window, keyboard input)

// 2. Clock the TeenyAT CPU a number of times

tny_clock(&t);

// 3. Update Game State (apply physics, check collisions)

// 4. Render Graphics (clear screen, draw level, draw player)

}

Step 3: Implement the bus_read Callback for Keyboard Input
Your TeenyAT program needs to read from address 0x4000 to get key presses. You must provide this data from your C++ host.

Action:
In your C++ game loop, check for keyboard presses (e.g., A, D, W) and store their state (pressed or not pressed).
Create a bus_read function (the counterpart to your existing bus_write).
When the addr in bus_read is 0x4000 (KEY_INPUT), package your key states into a single tny_uword bitmask as specified in your slides (Bit 0 for Left, Bit 1 for Right, Bit 2 for Jump).
Pass this tny_uword back to the TeenyAT through the data parameter of the bus_read function.
Phase 2: Programming the TeenyAT Game Logic
Now, you'll write the Assembly/C code that runs on the TeenyAT. This code will read the inputs you just prepared and trigger the movement peripherals.

Step 1: Create the Main Loop in Assembly/C
This will be the core logic of your game running on the virtual machine.

Action: Create a simple infinite loop in your TeenyAT assembly file.
Goal: This loop will continuously check for input and update the game.
Step 2: Read from the Keyboard Peripheral
Inside the loop, you need to read the button states from the address you set up in Phase 1.

Action: Use the lod instruction to load the value from the BUTTONS address (0x4000) into a register (e.g., rA). This will give you the bitmask of currently pressed keys.
Step 3: Check for Specific Key Presses
You need to determine which action the player wants to take based on the bits in the register.

Action: Use bitwise and and comparison cmp instructions to check if specific bits are set (e.g., bit 2 for jump). Your pseudo-code in the presentation is the perfect guide for this .
Step 4: Trigger Movement Peripherals
If a key is pressed, write to the corresponding address to tell the C++ host to perform an action.

Action: Use the str [ADDRESS], rZ instruction to "strobe" the write-only peripherals.
If the "jump" bit is set, write to MOVE_N (0x9016).
If the "left" bit is set, write to MOVE_W (0x9014).
If the "right" bit is set, write to MOVE_E (0x9017).
Phase 3: Building the Physics and World
This brings you back to main.cpp. The TeenyAT program is now telling you when the player wants to move; it's your job to actually make it happen on screen with physics.

Step 1: Create a Player Object/Struct
You need variables in main.cpp to keep track of the player's state.

Action: Create a struct or class in C++ to hold the player's properties:
float x, y; // Position
float velocityX, velocityY; // Velocity
Step 2: Handle Movement Writes in bus_write
Expand your bus_write function to handle the movement strobes from the TeenyAT.

Action: In your switch(addr) statement, add cases for MOVE_W, MOVE_E, and MOVE_N.
Logic:
case MOVE_W: Apply a westward acceleration (e.g., player.velocityX -= 5.0f;).
case MOVE_E: Apply an eastward acceleration (e.g., player.velocityX += 5.0f;).
case MOVE_N: Apply an instantaneous upward impulse for the jump (e.g., player.velocityY = -15.0f;).
Step 3: Implement the Physics Engine
In your main C++ game loop, you need to update the player's position based on their velocity and other forces.

Action: In the "Update Game State" part of your loop, add the following logic:
Apply Gravity: player.velocityY += GRAVITY * deltaTime;
Apply Friction/Drag: player.velocityX *= 0.9f;
Update Position: player.x += player.velocityX * deltaTime; and player.y += player.velocityY * deltaTime; (Note: deltaTime is the time elapsed since the last frame. It ensures smooth movement regardless of framerate.)
Step 4: Create the Level and Handle Collisions
The player needs a world to interact with.

Action:
Create a 2D array or vector to represent your static level, as planned. Each element will represent a tile (e.g., 0 for air, 1 for solid ground).
In your physics update, after calculating the player's new potential position, check if that new position overlaps with a solid tile in your level array.
If a collision occurs, stop the player's movement in that direction (e.g., if they hit the ground, set player.velocityY = 0; and snap their y-position to the top of the tile).
Phase 4: Bringing It All Together
This is the final stage where you add the remaining game elements and polish the experience.

Rendering: In the "Render Graphics" part of your C++ game loop, draw the level tiles based on your 2D array and then draw the player sprite at its final, updated player.x and player.y position.
Win Condition: Add the flagpole to your level map. In your update logic, simply check if the player's coordinates overlap with the flagpole's coordinates to trigger a win state.
Optional Features: To implement SPRITE_SET, have your TeenyAT program write a number to 0x9024. Your bus_write in C++ can catch this and change the texture it uses to draw the player.
By following these phases, you can systematically build your game, ensuring that the TeenyAT logic and the C++ host work together correctly. Good luck!
