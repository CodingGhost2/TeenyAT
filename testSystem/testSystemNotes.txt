Goals
-look at instructions, opcodes and encoding structure
-create really simple assembler for temporary ease of use only
-create a simple testing system
-create a test suite that covers all opcodes
-use test suite to confirm the functionality of the opcodes

Creating the simple assembler
-parse asm file and create tasm file tokenized assembly file
-parse tasm file and create bin or binary file
